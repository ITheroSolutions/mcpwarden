/**
 * Pin a server's surface, then detect when it changes.
 *
 * This is the durable half of mcpwarden. A conformance grade tells you about
 * today; a pin tells you whether what you approved is still what you have.
 *
 * The event this exists to catch is a tool description being rewritten after you
 * approved it. That is how tool poisoning presents: the name stays, the schema
 * stays, and the text the model actually reads is replaced.
 *
 * Run with:  node examples/03-pin-and-detect-drift.mjs <server-name>
