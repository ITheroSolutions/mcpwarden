/**
 * What a server's own configuration entry says to hand it when it starts.
 *
 * A server's configuration typically sets environment variables for it
 * (`DATA_DIR`, `DATABASE_URL`, an API key) and, for a remote server, request headers.
 * mcpwarden originally recorded only the *names*, and at connect time looked the
 * names up in its own environment instead. So a server whose configuration said
 * `DATA_DIR=C:\data` was started without it, exited, and could not be
 * inspected, even though the operator's own MCP client starts it fine.
 *
 * Each server now receives the values from its own configuration entry, which is
 * exactly what the operator's MCP client gives it. That is not a new disclosure:
 * the server is the intended recipient of its own configuration. What the stdio
 * transport exists to prevent is different and still holds: the operator's
 * *other* environment variables never reach a server unless its configuration
 * names them.
 *
 * The values never become part of a {@link ServerRef}. They are held in a
 * `WeakMap` keyed by the parsed endpoint object, so they cannot be serialised into
 * an inventory, a report, a ledger entry or a log line by accident, and they live
 * only as long as the inventory that parsed them. A `ServerRef` built any other
 * way, for example deserialised from JSON, simply has none, and connecting falls
 * back to the previous behaviour.
 *
 * Placeholders are filled the way the clients that write them do:
 *
 * - `${env:NAME}`, used by VS Code and Cursor.
 * - `${NAME}` and `${NAME:-default}`, used by Claude Code.
 * - `${userHome}`, used by VS Code.
 *
 * Anything else, `${input:...}` in particular, can only be filled by the client
 * that owns the configuration, usually by prompting. Such a value is left out
 * rather than passed through literally.
