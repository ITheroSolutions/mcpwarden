    severity: 'critical',
    why:
      'The initialize and notifications/initialized handshake was removed. A modern client never ' +
      'sends it, so a server that waits for it before serving requests will answer nothing.',
    fix:
      'Delete the initialize handler. Read the protocol version and client capabilities from each ' +

    id: 'MIG-SESSION',
    title: 'Mcp-Session-Id usage',
    rule: 'MW-HTTP-012',
    severity: 'critical',
    why:
      'Protocol level sessions and the Mcp-Session-Id header were removed. A server that mints or ' +
      'requires one is holding state a conforming client will never carry back.',
    fix:
      'Remove session minting and validation. State that must span requests becomes an explicit ' +
      'server minted handle passed as an ordinary tool argument.',
    codemodable: false,
  },
  {
    id: 'MIG-GET-STREAM',
    title: 'HTTP GET stream endpoint',
    rule: 'MW-HTTP-011',
    severity: 'high',

      'The standalone GET SSE endpoint was removed. Long lived notifications now flow on the ' +
      'response stream of a subscriptions/listen request instead.',
    fix: 'Respond 405 to GET on the MCP endpoint and implement subscriptions/listen.',

    id: 'MIG-RESUMABILITY',
    title: 'Last-Event-ID resumability',
    rule: 'MW-HTTP-012',
    severity: 'medium',
    why:
      'SSE stream resumability and message redelivery were removed. A broken stream now loses the ' +
      'in flight request and the client re-issues it with a new id.',
    fix: 'Delete the Last-Event-ID handling and the event id bookkeeping behind it.',
    codemodable: false,
  },
  {
    id: 'MIG-SUBSCRIBE',
    title: 'resources/subscribe or resources/unsubscribe',
    rule: 'SEP-2575',
    severity: 'high',
    why:
      'Both methods were replaced by a single subscriptions/listen request whose response stream ' +
      'carries the notifications the client opted in to.',

      'Servers may no longer send roots/list, sampling/createMessage or elicitation/create as their ' +
      'own JSON-RPC requests. Multi Round-Trip Requests replaced that pattern entirely.',

    rule: 'MW-CACHE-001',

    why:
      'Results from the list methods and resources/read must now carry ttlMs and cacheScope. A ' +
      'result without them is non conforming even though it still parses.',
    fix:
      'Add ttlMs, a freshness hint in milliseconds and never negative, and cacheScope of "public" ' +
      'or "private". Use "private" for anything that varies per user.',

  {
    id: 'MIG-ERROR-CODE',
    title: 'retired error code',
    rule: 'MW-ERR-002',
    severity: 'medium',
    why:
      'Code -32002 for resource not found was replaced by -32602, and -32042 was retired entirely. ' +
      'Codes introduced in draft were renumbered into the -32020 range.',

    why:
      'Roots, Sampling and Logging are deprecated with a minimum twelve month window. They still ' +
      'work, but new implementations should not adopt them.',

      'Pass directories or files through tool parameters or resource URIs instead of Roots. ' +

    severity: 'medium',
    why:
      'Tasks moved out of the core protocol into the io.modelcontextprotocol/tasks extension, and ' +
      'the redesign replaced the blocking tasks/result with polling via tasks/get and removed ' +
      'tasks/list.',
