/**
 * The append-only surface ledger.
 *
 * A tamper evident record of what every server advertised, every time it was
 * captured. This is the durable half of the package: a conformance grade tells you
 * about today, a ledger tells you what was true on the day you approved something
 * and whether it is still true now.
 *
 * ## Format
 *
 * A versioned header line, then one JSON entry per line. Newline delimited so a
 * reader never has to hold the whole file in memory and a truncated write damages
 * exactly one line.
 *
 * Each entry carries the hash of the previous entry, and its own hash is computed
 * over the canonical form of every preceding field including that link. Changing
 * any entry changes its hash, which breaks the link the next entry recorded, and
 * so on to the end. Verification walks the chain and reports the exact sequence
 * number where it breaks.
 *
 * `docs/formats.md` specifies this precisely enough that somebody could write an
 * independent verifier, which matters: a trust format nobody else can check is not
 * a trust format.
 *
 * ## What a hash chain does and does not give you
 *
 * It makes *undetected* modification hard. Someone who edits entry 40 in place
 * must also recompute 41 through the end, and verification catches them if they do
 * not.
 *
 * It does **not** stop a local attacker who can rewrite the file from entry zero.
 * Nothing here is externally anchored or notarised, so a complete forgery by
 * someone with write access verifies cleanly. That is stated plainly in
 * `docs/threat-model.md` rather than hidden behind the words "tamper evident".
