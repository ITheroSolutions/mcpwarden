/**
 * Deciding exactly what to execute for a configured stdio server.
 *
 * The stdio transport never routes a server's command through a shell, because
 * the command and its arguments come from a configuration file this package did
 * not write, and a shell turns an argument containing `&` into a second command.
 * On POSIX that is the whole story.
 *
 * On Windows it is not, and getting it wrong made most real servers unreachable.
 * `npx`, `dnx` and every npm installed command are batch files (`npx.cmd`), and
 * Windows cannot execute a batch file without its command interpreter. Spawned
 * directly, `npx` fails with ENOENT, since the loader only searches for `.exe`
 * and `.com`. Every MCP server configured as `npx some-package`, which is most of
 * them, was therefore impossible to capture.
 *
 * So on Windows a batch file is run through `cmd.exe /d /s /c`, with every
 * argument escaped so the interpreter treats it as literal text. The escaping is
 * the approach used by the widely deployed cross-spawn library, reimplemented
 * here because the package carries no runtime dependencies:
 *
 * - Each argument is quoted, with backslashes and embedded quotes escaped the way
 *   the Microsoft C runtime parses them back out.
 * - Every character `cmd.exe` treats specially, the quotes included, is prefixed
 *   with `^`, so the interpreter never enters or leaves a quoted region on its own
 *   and never sees `&`, `|`, `<` or `>` as operators.
 * - For batch files the metacharacters are escaped twice. A batch file such as
 *   `npx.cmd` forwards its arguments with `%*`, and the interpreter parses that
 *   line a second time. One level of escaping survives only the first parse,
 *   after which an argument like `a"&calc&"b` would run `calc`. cross-spawn
 *   applies the second level only to shims under `node_modules/.bin`; it is
 *   applied here to every batch file, because `npx.cmd` itself forwards `%*`.
 *
 * `%` is escaped as well. The interpreter expands `%NAME%` before it processes
 * carets, but `^%NAME^%` names a variable called `NAME^`, which does not exist
 * and is left untouched, after which the carets are removed.
 *
 * Delayed expansion (`!NAME!`) is off because `/v` is never passed.
