/**
 * stdio transport.
 *
 * Spawns a server as a child process and exchanges newline delimited JSON-RPC
 * over its standard streams (MW-STDIO-001).
 *
 * Three things here are easy to get wrong and are handled deliberately.
 *
 * **stderr is not an error channel.** The specification is explicit that a server
 * MAY write anything to stderr and that a client SHOULD NOT treat output there as
 * indicating a problem (MW-STDIO-003). It is captured separately, bounded, and
 * never merged into the message stream.
 *
 * **Shutdown is a sequence, not a kill.** Close stdin, wait for exit, force
 * terminate only if the server does not go (MW-STDIO-007). Servers are told to
 * exit when stdin closes, and honouring that is what keeps the common case clean.
 *
 * **On Windows, killing a process does not kill its descendants.** An MCP server
 * launched through `npx` or `cmd` is a shell that spawns the real server, so
 * killing the shell leaves the server running and holding its port or its file
 * locks. The whole tree is terminated explicitly.
