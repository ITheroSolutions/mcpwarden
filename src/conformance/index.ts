/**
 * Conformance grading.
 *
 * Runs the rule registry against a capture and produces a reproducible grade.
 *
 * ## Reproducibility
 *
 * The same server plus the same tool version must yield the same grade. Nothing
 * here reads a clock, a random source, or the network. A grade that drifts between
 * runs cannot be used as evidence, and evidence is the point.
 *
 * ## What counts
 *
 * MUST rules dominate. A single MUST failure caps the grade below a pass, because
 * "mostly implements a mandatory requirement" is not a thing.
 *
 * UNVERIFIED rules report but never affect the score. That is the mechanism that
 * lets the package include a plausible but ungrounded rule without that rule
 * silently changing anyone's grade, and it is why the registry can be honest about
 * uncertainty instead of quietly omitting it.
 *
 * `not-applicable` and `inconclusive` never count against a server either. A rule
 * that could not be tested is not a rule the server failed.
