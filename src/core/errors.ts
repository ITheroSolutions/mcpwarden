 * Every throw in this package is one of these types. No bare `Error`, no string
 * throws. Two reasons.
 *
 * **Machine readability.** The CLI maps a code to an exit status, the MCP server
 * maps it to a JSON-RPC error, and the report renderers group by it. A caller
 * should never have to match on a message string.
 *
 * **Redaction.** An error message is one of the four places that must never carry a
 * secret from reaching, and it is the easiest one to leak through, because the
 * natural way to write a transport error is to interpolate the thing that failed.
 * Every message and every detail value is passed through {@link redact} inside the
 * constructor, so a caller cannot forget.
