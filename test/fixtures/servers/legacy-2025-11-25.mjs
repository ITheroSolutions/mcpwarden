/**
 * A genuine 2025-11-25 legacy MCP server, built on the official SDK.
 *
 * One correct fixture per revision. The modern one is hand
 * written because no published SDK implements 2026-07-28, but the legacy one is
 * deliberately NOT hand written: this is exactly where the SDK devDependency
 * earns its keep.
 *
 * A legacy fixture we wrote ourselves would only prove that our client agrees
 * with our own reading of the old specification. Built on the SDK, it proves the
 * era probe and the downgrade path work against a real implementation somebody
 * else maintains, which is the only version of that test worth having.
 *
 * This server requires the `initialize` handshake and speaks no modern method, so
 * a modern request against it must fail deterministically rather than being half
 * understood.
