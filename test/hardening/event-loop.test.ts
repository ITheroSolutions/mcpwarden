/**
 * The awaited promise must always settle, in a process with nothing else running.
 *
 * Every other test in this suite runs under vitest, and the runner keeps its own
 * handles on the event loop. That hides an entire class of defect: a timer
 * created with `unref()` cannot hold the loop open by itself, so if it is the
 * only thing left scheduled, Node drains the loop and exits while a caller is
 * still awaiting the promise that timer was supposed to settle.
 *
 * Under vitest the timer always fires, because the runner is alive. In a bare
 * CLI process it never does. `mcpwarden conform <a server that dies on spawn>`
 * exited with code 13, ERR_UNSETTLED_TOP_LEVEL_AWAIT, printing no finding, no
 * error and no explanation.
 *
 * So these tests spawn a real Node process with nothing else in it. That is the
 * only configuration in which the bug is observable, which is exactly why it
 * survived 985 passing tests.
