# Open items and known limitations

Everything in this project that a careful user should know is uncertain, and
everything that still wants confirmation from somebody who has the right client or
the right environment in front of them.

Nothing here is a bug report. These are the places where the honest answer is
"probably, and here is why it is only probably".

---

## 1. Client configuration paths that could not be confirmed

Every path in `src/discovery/clients.ts` carries a `confidence` field. The ones below
are `probable` rather than `confirmed`. They are implemented and scanned, but a wrong
path means an inventory reports a clean machine when the truth is that it looked in
the wrong place, which is the worst failure mode this component has.

**Confirmed against documentation:**

| Client | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Desktop | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`, `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`, `~/.config/claude-desktop/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude.json` |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` |
| VS Code | `<user dir>/Code/User/mcp.json`, shape `servers`. Also confirmed empirically: a real `discover` run located servers there and parsed them with the `servers` shape. |
| Windsurf | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` (same on Windows). Confirmed against Windsurf's own Cascade MCP docs (docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/cascade/mcp). The file does not exist until a server is first added through the Windsurf UI; its absence means no servers configured yet, not a wrong path. |
| Cline | `~/.cline/data/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`, falling back to `<VS Code global storage>/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`. Confirmed against Cline's own docs and cline/cline GitHub issues: Cline 4.x moved MCP settings out of the VS Code extension's globalStorage into a shared, editor-independent data directory. The legacy globalStorage file is read once on first launch to migrate, then Cline stops writing to it, so it is checked second, as a fallback for installs that have not migrated. |
| Zed | Linux/macOS: `~/.config/zed/settings.json`. Windows: `%APPDATA%\Zed\settings.json`, shape `context_servers`. Confirmed against zed-industries/zed's own `docs/src/configuring-zed.md`. The previous entry used the Linux/macOS path unconditionally on every platform, which would have silently missed every Windows Zed install. Windows uses a different path with different capitalization, not a variant of the same one. |

Claude Desktop and Claude Code were also confirmed empirically by that same run, which
detected configuration for both.

One caveat survives for VS Code. It additionally supports a workspace
`.vscode/mcp.json`, which a machine wide scan cannot enumerate without walking every
project directory. Those are found only when a directory is named explicitly.

**Probable, needing confirmation:**

| Client | Assumed path | Why it is uncertain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generic | `mcp.json`, `.mcp.json` in a named directory | A convention rather than anything specified. Shape assumed to match the common `mcpServers` form. |

**How to help.** Configure one MCP server in a client you actually use and run
`mcpwarden discover`, then confirm the server appears. `absentPaths` in the inventory
lists every location checked, so a path that is wrong shows up there rather than being
invisible. A corrected path is the single most useful pull request this project can
receive.

**Note on shapes.** Three distinct config shapes are handled: `mcpServers` (Claude
Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline), `servers` (VS Code), and
`context_servers` (Zed). If a client changes shape, its servers silently vanish from
the inventory rather than erroring, because a file with no recognised server map is a
normal and common case.

## 2. Unverified conformance rules

None currently. Every requirement in `SPEC-NOTES.md` was taken from specification text
with a citation.

This section lists any rule that ends up marked `UNVERIFIED`. Such a rule reports its
finding but never affects the graded score, so a rule whose grounding is uncertain can
never cost a server a grade it did not deserve.

---

## 3. Specification coverage is partial by design

`SPEC-NOTES.md` records roughly seventy normative requirements. Seventeen became graded
rules. The remainder fall into three groups, and none was silently dropped:

- Requirements that bind the client rather than the server, which a server grader has
  no standing to check.
- Requirements needing an authorization flow, which the capture path does not perform.
- Requirements needing an HTTP level probe beyond what a capture makes available.

Rules that would depend on specification pages not yet incorporated are deferred rather
than invented. A grader that guesses at a requirement is worse than one that admits a
gap, because a wrong citation is indistinguishable from a right one to anybody who does
not already know the answer.

## 4. The MCP SDK does not implement this revision

`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.30.0`, the latest published version, was released
2026-07-27, one day before the 2026-07-28 specification was finalised, and references
only `2025-06-18` and `2025-11-25`. It contains no occurrence of `2026-07-28`.

This is why the protocol client is hand written and why the package carries zero runtime
dependencies. See `DECISIONS.md` D-002. The SDK is retained as a devDependency because it
provides a real legacy server to test downgrade behaviour against.

**Worth revisiting if** a 2026-07-28 capable SDK ships. Even then it would apply to the
transport layer only, never to the conformance prober, which must send deliberately
malformed requests. That is precisely what a correct client library exists to prevent.

---

## 5. Repository and disclosure metadata

`package.json` carries `github.com/ITheroSolutions/mcpwarden` for `repository`,
`homepage` and `bugs`. The same URL appears as `informationUri` in the SARIF renderer
and in the `CHANGELOG.md` compare link. All three move together if the repository is
ever renamed.

**Resolved (2026-08-16):** keep both. GitHub private vulnerability reporting is the
primary route, and the mailbox in `SECURITY.md` stays as a fallback for anyone who does
not have or want a GitHub account. See `SECURITY.md` for the current wording.

## 6. Package contents

The published tarball was unpacked and installed into a scratch project as a real
dependency rather than merely listed, and exercised there.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Top level files | `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `package.json`, `dist/` only |
| Tests, fixtures or specifications inside | none |
| Ledger, pin or captured surface files inside | none |
| Runtime dependencies of the installed package | `{}` |
| `import { ... } from 'mcpwarden'` | resolves |
| `import { inventory } from 'mcpwarden/api'` | resolves |
| Type declarations | present for every entry point |
| `dist/cli/index.js --version` | prints the version |
| `dist/cli/index.js discover --format json` | valid JSON |
| `dist/mcp/index.js` answering `server/discover` | correct result, identifies as `mcpwarden` |

CI runs the same inspection on every push, including a positive check that the required
entry points are present. An earlier version of that check matched the bare word
`ledger` and so flagged `dist/ledger/index.js`, which is compiled source rather than
captured data. A check that cries wolf on every build is a check people learn to ignore,
so the pattern now matches only captured state: `.mcpwarden-ledger`, `.pin.json` and
`.surface.json`.
